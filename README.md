This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting: improper handling of filenames containing spaces.  The `bug.sh` script shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.sh` provides the corrected version. The issue stems from word splitting in the `for` loop, leading to unexpected behavior when filenames contain spaces. The solution involves using an array to correctly iterate through files.
